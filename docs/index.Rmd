    - Spatial Prediction and Model Selection


# Areal Data Overview

## Areal Data

Defining features: random observation measured at well defined subsets, such as a city or state.

```{r, out.width = "95%", echo = F, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap='source: https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/montana/'}
knitr::include_graphics("Tester.png") 
```

## Areal Data Exercise

**Recall:** How can spatial information be incorporated with this data structure?

```{r, out.width = "95%", echo = F, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap='source: https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/montana/'}
knitr::include_graphics("Tester.png") 
```
